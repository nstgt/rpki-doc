"After the installation has completed, there are just two things you need "
"to configure before you can start using Krill. First, you will need a a "
"data directory, which will store everything Krill needs to run. Secondly,"
" you will need to create a basic configuration file, specifying a secret "
"token and the location of your data directory."

"Krill uses HTTPS and refuses to do plain HTTP. By default Krill will "
