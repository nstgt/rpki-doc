"It is highly recommended to use an RPKI publication server provided by "
"your parent CA, if available. This relieves you of the responsibility to "
"keep a public rsync and web server available at all times."
msgstr ""

"It could also be considered good for the RPKI ecosystem as a whole to "
"have at least some centralisation of publication. If Relying Party "
"software around the world has to periodically fetch data from possibly "
"hundreds of RPKI repositories with various degrees of availability and "
"latency, this would not result in speedy updates."

"Please keep in mind that it is crucial to ensure that your certificate "
"and ROAs remain available at all times. When the Krill CA is unavailable "
"you will not be able to make updates to your ROAs, and Krill will not "
"(re-)publish objects at a repository. This does not need to affect "
"relying parties as long as the repository remains available, and Krill "
"comes back before objects start to become stale. You have 8 hours with "
"the current built-in defaults."

"That being said, only Brazilian NIC.br members can configure a hosted "
"publication server without manual intervention at this time. APNIC "
"members can get access to their publication server upon request. Everyone"
" else will need to host their own repository for now."

"When running your own repository, it is advisable to use multiple rsync "
"servers and multiple web servers. You can also use a Content Delivery "
"Network (CDN) in front of your web servers. Please note that the official"
" name for the HTTPS based transport is the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol"
" (RRDP), so you will see this abbreviation used throughout the "
"documentation."

"Please note it is practically impossible to change the configuration of "
"Krill's embedded repository after it has been initialised. For production"
" environments where you may want to change strategies over time we "
"recommend running a separate Krill instance running as a repository only,"
" as described in :ref:`doc_krill_remote_publishing`."

"Krill can use an embedded repository to publish RPKI objects. It can "
"generate the required configuration for you using the :command:`krillc "
"config` subcommand. This ensures the syntax is correct, as for example "
"trailing slashes are required. Use this command with your own values, "
"using domain names pointing to servers that are publicly reachable."

msgid "Krill will write the repository files under its data directory:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/krill/publication-server.rst:66
msgid ""
"You can share the contents of these directories with your repository "
"servers in various ways. It is possible to have a redundant shared file "
"system where the Krill CA can write, and your repository servers can "
"read. Alternatively, you can synchronise the contents of these "
"directories in another way, such as Rsyncing them over every couple of "
"minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/krill/publication-server.rst:72
msgid ""
"If you are using a shared file system, please note that the rsync "
":file:`/current` directory cannot be the mount point. Krill tries to "
"write the entire repository to a new folder under "
":file:`$DATA_DIR/repo/rsync` and then renames it. This is done to "
"minimise issues with files being updated while relying party software is "
"fetching data."

"The next step is to configure your rsync daemons to expose a 'module' for"
" your files. Make sure that the Rsync URI including the 'module' matches "
"the :file:`rsync_base` in your Krill configuration file. Basic "
"configuration can then be as simple as:"

"For RRDP you will need to set up a web server of your choice and ensure "
"that it has a valid TLS certificate. Next, you can make the files found "
"under, or copied from :file:`$DATA_DIR/repo/rrdp` available here. Make "
"sure that the public URI to the RRDP base directory matches the value of "
"``rrdp_service_uri`` in your :file:`krill.conf` file."

"If desired, you can also use a CDN in front of this server to further "
"reduce your load and uptime requirements. If you do, make sure that the "
"public URI matches the directive in :file:`krill.conf`, because this will"
" be used in your RPKI certificate."

"If you find that there is an issue with your repository or, for example, "
"you want to change its domain name, you can set up a new Krill instance "
"with an embedded repository. When you are satisfied that the new one is "
"correct, you can migrate your CA to it by adding them as a publisher "
"under the new repository server, and then updating your CA to use the new"
" repository."

"Krill will then make sure that objects are moved properly, and that a new"
" certificate is requested from your parent(s) to match the new location. "
"This scenario would also apply when your RIR starts providing a "
"repository service. You can update your CA to start publishing there "
"instead."
